<b>Accredited Investor NFT</b>

Accredited Investor Defined: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor">Wiki</a>
An accredited or sophisticated investor is a qualifying status that allows an individual access to investing in financial instruments deemed too risky for the average investor. In the US the Securities Exchange Commision creates the qualification standards and many countries have similar programs in place. A common qualification is the fiat equivalent of $1m US in assets over an individual's liabilities.

Why this matters:
With regulation catching up to technology, crypto markets will be further regulated in the pursuit of safety for the average investor. This limits the products available to investors, cutting out a large source of funding for startups. This also adds risk and compliance requirement costs for startups looking for funding.

Part of the solution: Blockchain Sophisticated Investors(BSIs)
The steady growth of blockchain technology has allowed early risk taking adopters to create and build wealth through blockchain assets. Currently, with little guidance and experience, most accountants would have trouble verifying multiple accounts, across multiple chains of assets and valuing them appropriately to meet the qualification requirements. Luckily weâ€™re developers and not accountants.

Build: Encrypted web2 portal allowing BSIs to send offline signed messages for verification of assets. Use cryptology to verify signatures and pull public addresses. Use sponsored products Moralis & or Covalent to pull balance data of tokens. Use Chainlink data to convert to fiat equivalent. If total is greater then $1m US mint Non Transferable NFT to account specified by BSI. Look into storing ZK proof of offchain verification(not needed but needs to be mentioned). Delete linking data for privacy.

Note: The reason we are doing this offchain as opposed to on is the privacy implications of linking accounts together may currently be a little out of reach based on current methods. The DAO formed to approve qualifications can be thought of as a trusted oracle and really no identifiable data needs to be provided to prove one owns their corresponding assets.

I believe up to this point is an attainable Minimum Viable Product to launch in the short time we have. Although somewhat boring, it has great utility. 

The next part of the presentation and idea involves the vision we need to craft of where this product can go and how it can solve problems brought on by future regulation. This is where we actually sell the judges and win awards, the first part is just the major hurdle to be considered, namely building a working MVP or prototype.


This is where we get creative.
Brainstorm - Feel free to add:
Curated network of startups looking for funding to offer to BSIs as a subscription service.
